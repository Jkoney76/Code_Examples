The purpose of this repository is to archive my Java programs.  All content is self-generated and is intended for non-commercial use.  These are simple programs done to increase my personal programming proficiency.  They are published here for others to view my progress and assess my programming competency.

Any questions, comments, or concerns may be directed to me via email at richarddunks(at)gmail.com.

Thank you.
